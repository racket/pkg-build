@title{Pkg-Build: Building and Testing All Racket Packages}

The @racketmodname[pkg-build] library supports building all packages
from a given catalog and using a given snapshot (i.e., installer plus
snapshot's packages). The build of each package is isolated through a
virtual machine, using either Docker or VirtualBox, and the result is
a set of built packages, a set of documentation, and package test
results. For example, @racketmodname[pkg-build] is used to drive
@url{https://pkg-build.racket-lang.org/} and generate the content of
@url{https://docs.racket-lang.org/}.

To successfully build, a package must
@;
@itemlist[

  @item{install without error;}

  @item{correctly declare its dependencies (but incorrect declaration
        may work, anyway, if the build order happens to accommodate);}
    
  @item{depend on packages that build successfully on their own;}

  @item{refer only to other packages in the snapshot and catalog
       (and, in particular, must not use PLaneT packages);}

  @item{build without special system libraries.}

]
@;
A successful build does not require that its declared dependencies are
complete if the needed packages end up installed, anyway, but the
declared dependencies are checked. Even when a build is unsuccessful,
any documentation that is built along the way is extracted, if
possible.

@section{Building Packages with Docker}

First, install @hyperlink["https://www.docker.com/"]{Docker}. As long
as @exec{docker} is in your path, that may be all you need, because
suitable starting images @tt{racket/pkg-build-deps} and/or
@tt{racket/pkg-build-deps-min} can be downloaded automatically by
Docker. See @secref["starting-image"] for more information about the
content of a suitable starting image.

In the @filepath{pkg-build} package sources, see the
@filepath{examples/docker} directory for an example use of
@racket[build-pkgs] with Docker.

@section{Building Packages with VirtualBox}

First, install @hyperlink["https://www.virtualbox.org/"]{VirtualBox}
and ensure that @exec{VBoxManage} is in your path.

You will need to create a suitable VirtualBox virtual machine
containing a Linux distribution (we recommend any recent version of
Ubuntu). See @secref["starting-image"] for more information about the
content of a suitable starting image. With those dependencies in
place, you will need to configure the virtual machine:
@;
@itemlist[

 @item{Create a @tt{racket} user.}

 @item{Ensure that the @tt{racket} user can run @tt{sudo} without a password.}

 @item{Install the OpenSSH server, and add your public key from
       @filepath{~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub} on your host to the @tt{racket}
       user's list of authorized keys in
       @filepath{~/.ssh/authorized_keys} on the virtual machine.}

 @item{Switch the virtual machine to host-only networking and take
       note of its IP address.}

 @item{Take a snapshot of the virtual machine called @tt{init}.}

 @item{Shut down the virtual machine.}

]

In the @filepath{pkg-build} package sources, see the
@filepath{examples/vbox} directory for an example use of
@racket[build-pkgs] with VirtualBox.

@section[#:tag "starting-image"]{Starting Image Requirements}

The @racket[build-pkgs] function expects a Docker image or VirtualBox
machine with just Linux installed. The installation can be minimal,
but CA certificates and timezone information are recommended. (Even
though network access in the virtual machine should be disabled, basic
configuration is helpful to some libraries.)

Some Racket packages may try to use a C compiler or run tests that
need an GUI context (i.e., an X11 server). To support those packages,
consider including @tt{gcc} and having an X11 server set up. If you
are interested in distinguishing packages that have minimal system
dependencies from those that require more, @racket[build-pkgs] allows
you to specify ``full'' and ``minimal'' starting variants.

See the @filepath{examples/docker/pkg-build-deps} and
@filepath{examples/docker/pkg-build-deps-min} directories of the
@filepath{pkg-build} package source for @filepath{Dockerfile}s that
create suitable starting images.


@section[#:tag "work-dir"]{Work Directory Content}

The @racket[build-pkgs] function needs a work directory where it will
assemble packages and results. The generated content of the work
directory can be used as a catalog of built packages plus web-friendly
files that report build and test results.

If the work directory content persists across calls to
@racket[build-pkgs], then @racket[build-pkgs] will incrementally
rebuild changed packages and other packages that depends on them.
However, a work directory must be reused only when the configuration
supplied to @racket[build-pkgs] does not change.

The work directory will include the following files and directories,
most of which are output, some of which record state for the purpose
of incremental builds, and very few of which are treated as extra
inputs:

@itemlist[

 @item{@filepath{installer/} --- Holds an installer downloaded
       from a snapshot site.}

 @item{@filepath{install-uuids.rktd} --- Holds a mapping of @tech{VM}
        names to IDs for prepared Docker containers or VirtualBox
        snapshots.}

 @item{@filepath{install-list.rktd} --- A list of packages found in
       the installation.}

 @item{@filepath{install-adds.rkt} --- A table of documentation,
       libraries, etc. in the installation, which is used to detect
       conflicts.}

 @item{@filepath{install-doc.tgz} --- A copy of installation's
       documentation.}

 @item{@filepath{server/archive} --- Archived packages from the
       snapshot site plus additional specified catalogs.}

 @item{@filepath{state.sqlite} --- Records the state of
       @filepath{server/archive} for incremental updates.}

 @item{@filepath{all-pkgs.rktd} --- A list of available package at
       most recent build, which is used to avoid re-building packages
       that will fail again due to missing dependencies.}

 @item{@filepath{force-pkgs.rktd} --- A list of packages to force a
       rebuild; this file is an input, and it is deleted after it is
       used.}

 @item{@filepath{server/built} --- Built packages. For each package
       @italic{P}, this directory contains one of the following:

       @itemlist[

           @item{@filepath{pkgs/@italic{P}.orig-CHECKSUM} (same as the
                 checksum in the archived catalog),
                 @filepath{pkgs/@italic{P}.zip} (built package), and
                 @filepath{pkgs/@italic{P}.zip.CHECKSUM} (built
                 package's checksum) --- An up-to-date package that
                 successfully built.

                 Additional files:

                   @item{possibly @filepath{min-fail/@italic{P}.txt} --- records failure on minimal-host attempt}

                 ]}

           @item{@filepath{pkgs/@italic{P}.orig-CHECKSUM} (same as the
                 checksum in the archived catalog) and
                 @filepath{fail/@italic{P}.txt} --- An up-to-date
                 package that failed to build.
                 An @filepath{install/@italic{P}.txt} file may
                 nevertheless report installation success in the sense that
                 @exec{raco pkg install} failed only in its @exec{raco setup} step.}

           @item{@filepath{archive-fail/@italic{P}.orig-CHECKSUM} --- Archiving failure.}

         ]}

   @item{@filepath{dumpster/} --- Saved builds of failed packages if
         the package at least installs (and failure was in the
         @exec{raco setup} step), because maybe the attempt built some
         documentation.}

   @item{@filepath{doc/} --- Unpacked documentation with non-conflicting
         packages installed.}

   @item{@filepath{all-doc.tgz} --- The same content as
         @filepath{doc/}, but still packed.}

   @item{@filepath{summary.rktd} ---A summary of build results as a
         hash table mapping each package name to another hash table
         with the following keys:

                   @item{@racket[(list 'docs/main _name _path)]}
                 ]}
           @item{@racket['conflict-log] --- @racket[#f], a relative path, or

           ]}

   @item{@filepath{index.html} (and @filepath{robots.txt}, etc.) --- A summary of results in
         web-page form.}

   @item{@filepath{site.tgz} or @filepath{site.tar} --- All files meant to populate a
         web site, including a @filepath{doc/} directory of documentation and a
         @filepath{server/built/catalog/} catalog of built packages that are in
         @filepath{server/built/pkgs/}. The packed form @filepath{site.tgz} is
         created unless @racket[#:compress-site?] is provided as @racket[#f].}

Using this information, the @racket[build-pkgs] rebuilds a package is
if its checksum changes or if one of its declared dependencies
changes.
