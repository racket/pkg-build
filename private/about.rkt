                    @p{The package-build service does not support
references to @a[href: "http://planet.racket-lang.org"]{PLaneT
packages} or to compatibility packages at
@literal-url{https://planet-compats.racket-lang.org/}. When a package
depends on one of those, then the package installation fails, because
package builds are performed on a VM without network
connectivity.}

                    @hx{Few System Libraries Are Installed}

                    @p{Each package is installed on a minimal VM that
omits as many system libraries and tools as is practical. If building
on the minimal VM fails, the package build is retried on a VM with
more tools and libraries, including a C compiler and an X server
running at @tt{:1}. Look for @|ldquo|extra system dependencies@|rdquo| in
the result column for packages that don@|rsquo|t work in the minimal
environment but do work in the extended one.}

                    @p{The idea behind the minimal VM is that a
package generally shouldn@|rsquo|t rely on tools that a Racket user
may not have installed@|mdash|and so it@|rsquo|s worth reporting
those problems from the package-build service. At the same time, a
package might be intended to work only in a typical Unix setup, and
witholding a C compiler, for example, would be especially uncooperative of
the package-build service.}

                    @hx{Test Capabilities May Be Limited}

                    @p{Limited system libraries, missing network
connectivity, or other constraints may prevent the package-build
service from straighforwardly running a package@|rsquo|s tests. See
@a[href: "#test"]{Dealing with Test Failures}.}

                    @hx{Native Libraries Need Special Handling}

                    @p{Even on the extended VM, the available system
libraries are limited. See @a[href: "#foreign"]{Working with Native
Libraries} below for information on implementing packages that rely on
additional native libraries.}

                    @hx{Platform-Specific Compiled Files May Not Be In @tt{"compiled"}}

                    @p{When the package-build service is meant to
generate a catalog of built packages for use with multiple variants of
Racket (i.e., CS on different platforms as well as BC), then
@tt{"compiled"} will contain machine-independent compiled code, which
loads slowly. Machine-specific compiled code is loaded though a
separate filesystem location as specified by the
@tt{current-compiled-file-roots} parameter and @tt{PLTCOMPILEDROOTS}
environment variable. Using the content of @tt{"compiled"} directly or
trying to run @tt{raco make} or @tt{raco setup} in a subprocess can go
wong without taking extra care.}

                    @; ----------------------------------------
                    @h3[id: "test"]{Dealing with Test Failures}

                    @p{In the absence of any @tt{"info.rkt"}-based
specifications or @tt{test} submodules, @tt{raco test} runs each
module in a package. Running a particular module might fail if
it@|rsquo|s a program-starting module that expects command-line
arguments, or a module might start a program that expects input and
causes the test to time out.}

                    @p{In the simplest case, you can add a @tt{test} submodule as}

                    @pre{  (module test racket/base)}

                    @p{}

                    @p{to make @tt{raco test} ignore the enclosing
module. You can control @tt{raco test} in various other ways through
submodules and @tt{"info.rkt"} files@";" see
@a[href: "https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/test.html"]{the
documentation}.}

                    @p{The default timeout on an individual test is 90 seconds, and the
overall timeout for testing a package is 10 minutes. You can adjust the
former, but the latter is a hard limit for now.}

                    @p{Tests are always run on the extended VM, but even so,
sometimes the package-build service cannot run a package@|rsquo|s tests. For
example, if a package needs network access for testing, the
package-build service can@|rsquo|t help, because it runs on an isolated
VM. There@|rsquo|s no way for a package to opt out of
testing, but a package author can implement a test suite that skip tests
under adverse conditions. In case there@|rsquo|s no other way for a test
suite to determine that it can@|rsquo|t run, the package-build service sets
the @tt{PLT_PKG_BUILD_SERVICE} and @tt{CI} environment variables when running
tests@";" a test suite can explicitly check for the environment
variable and skip tests that can@|rsquo|t work.}


                    @; ----------------------------------------
                    @h3[id: "foreign"]{Working with Native Libraries}

                    @p{The @|ldquo|minimal@|rdquo| versus
@|ldquo|extended@|rdquo| VM distinction begs the question of how the
package-build service can support a package that relies on a native
library@|mdash|one that is not installed even on the extended VM.}

                    @p{It would be nice to have a bridge between the
Racket package system and the OS package manager so that dependencies
on OS packages could be declared and installed. One catch is that the
bridge would have to work with a package-build VM that is isolated
from the network. The networking, permission, and maintenance issues
seem complex enough that we haven@|rsquo|t embarked on that direction.}

                    @p{For now, the package-build installation
identifies itself as running on the @tt{"x86_64-linux-natipkg"}
platform, as opposed to plain @tt{"x86_64-linux"}. On the plain
@tt{"x86_64-linux"} platform, native libraries as needed by Racket
packages are expected to be installed by a user through the
OS@|rsquo|s package manager. On the @tt{"x86_64-linux-natipkg"}
platform, however, native libraries are handled as on Windows and Mac
OS: they are expected to be provided by platform-specific packages.}

                    @p{For example, on the @tt{"x86_64-linux-natipkg"}
platform, the @tt{"math-lib"} package depends on the
@tt{"math-x86_64-linux-natipkg"} package, which provides 64-bit Linux
builds of GMP and MPFR. You can see that dependency declaration in the
@tt{"info.rkt"} file for the @tt{"math-lib"} package:}

                    @pre{  @literal-url{https://github.com/racket/math/blob/master/math-lib/info.rkt}}

                    @p{Other example packages are
@tt{"draw-x86_64-linux-natipkg-3"}, which includes Cairo and Pango
builds, and @tt{"gui-x86_64-linux-natipkg"}, which includes a Gtk
build. These natipkg builds are not better than the ones that are
normally part of a Linux installation---in fact, they tend to be
compiled in a way that supports fewer features---but they can be
installed in a relatively minimal Linux installation for purposes like
the package-build service.}

                    @p{If your package depends on a native
library, then you currently have two main options:}

                    @hx{Accomodate Unavailable Libraries}

                    @p{One option is to make the package behave when the native library is unavailable.}

                    @p{Typically, a native library that is accessed via @tt{ffi/unsafe}
                       isn@|rsquo|t needed to merely build a package
                       (including its documentation). If possible, delay any use of the
                       native library to run time so that the package can build without it.}

                    @p{For tests, you can either just let them fail, or you can adjust the
                       test suite to avoid failure reports when the native library is
                       unavailable or (if you must) when @tt{PLT_PKG_BUILD_SERVICE} is defined.}

                    @hx{Distribute Native Libraries}

                    @p{Another option is to build a 64-bit Linux
version of the library, distribute it as a package, and make
the package a platform-specific dependency of your package for the
@tt{"x86_64-linux-natipkg"} platform.}

                    @p{This option is in many ways the best one for
users and for testing@|mdash|especially if Windows and Mac OS
native-library packages are also provided@|mdash|but it@|rsquo|s more work.}
